title: Choosing a Language

description: What languages you can use for programming contests.
---

The most popular languages that USACO supports are [C++11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B), [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)), and [Python 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)). Pascal used to be popular in the past, but its use is rare now, and many programming contests have removed or are planning to remove support for it in the near future (in short: don't use it now). C is also supported, but it's essentially a strictly inferior version of C++ and doesn't have the built-in data structures that are often used. In general, we recommend the following:

 - **If you already know one of these languages, just use it.**
   - If you know multiple languages, we recommend you pick C++ over Java, and Java over Python.
 - **For Bronze, any language will do.** It is possible to receive full credit with C++, Java, and Python in Bronze.
 - **For Silver<Asterisk>However, if Python is the only language you know / you really want to use Python, you can still pass Silver with Python.</Asterisk>, Gold, and Platinum, Python is not recommended**, because it is a slow language and lacks an ordered map.
 - Check [Factors to Consider When Choosing a Language](/intro/factors-choosing) for more information.

Keep in mind that it's easy to switch languages down the road. Don't get caught up on which language to choose. Just pick the one you feel most comfortable with!

## Resources for Learning How to Code

If you aren't comfortable with basic coding yet, you can use the resources below. Let us know what works (or doesn't) for you.

### General

<Resources title="Learning to Code">
  <Resource title="Sololearn" url="https://www.sololearn.com/" starred>free courses for C++, Java, Python</Resource>
  <Resource title="Codecademy" url="https://www.codecademy.com/">free courses for C++, Java, Python 2, others are paid</Resource>
</Resources>

### C++

Use one of the resources above or below (or find your own) to learn C++. If you use Sololearn, you don't have to complete the full course; we recommend you finish everything up to (and including) "Functions."

<Resources title="C++">
  <Resource source="PAPS" title="2 - Programming in C++" starred>lots of examples, Kattis exercises</Resource>
</Resources>

<Info title="Pro Tip">

You do not need to learn pointers (for now). Knowledge of structs and classes is useful but not required.
