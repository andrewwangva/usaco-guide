</Resources>

  - [AtCoder](https://beta.atcoder.jp/contests/archive)
    - probably the highest quality, although difficulty isn't *always* reasonable
    - Contests
      - Beginner / Regular: 4 or 6 problems, ~100 min
      - Grand: 6 problems, 110 - 150 min
  - [Codeforces](http://codeforces.com/problemset)
    - Contests
      - Div 1/2/3/(4?): 5-6 problems (with some variations), 2 to 2.5 hrs
    - Archive
      - problem quality, difficulty ratings are ok but not always great
  - [Topcoder](https://www.topcoder.com/my-dashboard/)
    - Div 2, Div 1
    - 75 min coding, 15 min challenge
    - Solutions only tested after contest!
