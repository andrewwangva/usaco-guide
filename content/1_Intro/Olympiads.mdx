## [USACO](http://www.usaco.org/)

  * Older Problems
    * [TJ website](http://tjsct.wikidot.com/usaco/)
    * [Korean website to submit ...](https://www.acmicpc.net/category/106)
  * [USACO Training](http://train.usaco.org/usacogate)
    * not particularly beginner-friendly, maybe helpful
    * lacks a lot of the topics in this guide (ex. segment tree)
    * I did the first five chapters in one summer (though I had to look up some solutions when I got stuck)
  * [Article](https://www.usenix.org/legacy/bodinfo/bod/bodmarch10/future.pdf)
    * an interesting read ...

<!-- Quotes: -->

> USACO thus faces a dilemma: should USACO continue to train the world and expose all its best pedagogical technologies to students from all different countries? Should USACO keep the best techniques
secret just for US students?

<!-- > Training and competition paradigms which attract and reward loners rather than encouraging collaboration and socialization ... Their conversations at training camp concern algorithms and mathematics ... and little else. Generally (with a few notable exceptions), they would not be viewed as well-balanced or particularly socially adept in their interactions with adults and as observed by adults at camp and on trips.
