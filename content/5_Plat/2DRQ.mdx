The key observation here is that heights never decrease. Consider the following (simpler) problem: how can we do 1D range updates/queries without lazy propagation if values never decrease? To solve this, we store 2 values in each segment: the maximum value in that segment the last time all values in it were equal, and the maximum value in that segment currently. Using this and generalising it to 2D is left as an exercise for the reader."),

<Optional title="Range Update and Range Query in Higher Dimensions">

Lazy propagation on segment trees does not extend to higher dimensions. However, you can extend the 1D BIT solution to solve range increment range sum in higher dimensions as well! See [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1311.6093.pdf) for details.

## 2D Offline Sum Queries

<Problems problems={problems.offSam} />

The intended complexity is $O(N\log^2 N)$ with a good constant factor. This requires updating points and querying rectangle sums $N$ times for points with coordinates in the range $[1,N]$. However The 2D BITs mentioned above use $O(N^2)$ memory, which is too much. Since we know all of the updates and queries beforehand, we can reduce the memory usage while maintaining a decent constant factor.

### Idea 1: Use an unordered map instead of a 2D array.

Bad idea ... This gives $O(N\log^2N)$ memory and time and the constant factors for both are terrible.

### Idea 2: Compress the points to be updated so that you only need $O(N\log N)$ memory. 

This doesn't require knowing the queries beforehand.

It's a bit difficult to pass the above problem within the time limit. Make sure to use fast input (and not `endl`)!

  - [thecodingwizard's implementation with 2D offline BIT above](https://github.com/thecodingwizard/competitive-programming/blob/master/DMOJ/Soriyas%20Programming%20Project.cpp)

### Idea 3: Use divide & conquer with a 1D BIT

  - mentioned in [this article](https://robert1003.github.io/2020/01/31/cdq-divide-and-conquer.html)
  - [thecodingwizard's (messy) implementation](https://github.com/thecodingwizard/competitive-programming/blob/master/DMOJ/Soriya%20Programming%20Project%201d%20BIT%20cdq%20dnc.cpp) based off above

### Problems

## 2D Segment Tree

Basically a segment tree of (maybe sparse) segment trees (or BBSTs, see "Advanced - Treap").

<Info title="Pro Tip">

This is **not** the same as [Quadtree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadtree). If the coordinates go up to $C$, then 2D segment tree queries run in $O(\log^2C)$ time each but some queries make Quadtree take $\Theta(C)$ time!

### Reducing Memory Usage

Naively, inserting $N$ elements into a sparse segment tree requires $O(N\log C)$, giving a memory bound of $O(N\log^2C)$ on 2D segment tree memory. This is usually too much for $N=10^5$ (although it sufficed for "Mowing the Field" due to the higher memory limit). 

To resolve this, reduce the memory usage of sparse segment tree while maintaing the same $O(N\log C)$ insertion time (see the solution for IOI Game below for details).
