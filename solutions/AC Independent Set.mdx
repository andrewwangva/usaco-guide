**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(\sum N)$

Root the tree at node $1$, allowing us to define the subtree of each node. Let $dp_0[v]$ represent the number of ways the subtree can be painted such that v is 
painted white. Similarily, let $dp_1[v]$ represent the number of ways the subtree can be painted such that v is painted white. 

##Painted White##

The number of ways to paint a subtree such that the root node is painted white is the product of all the ways to paint each subtree. In other words,

$$
dp_0[v] = \prod_{u \in child(v)} dp_0[u]+ dp_1[u]
$$

##Painted Black##

Since no two adjacent nodes can both be painted black, if the root node of the subtree is painted black, none of its children can be painted black. The number of
ways to paint a subtree such that the root node is painted black is the product of all the ways the subtree can be painted white. 

$$
dp_1[v] = \prod_{u \in child(v)} dp_0[u]
$$

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int MOD = 1000000007;
long dp[2][100000];
vector<int> adj[100000];
void dfs(int i, int p){
    dp[0][i] = 1;
    dp[1][i] = 1;
    for(int v : adj[i]){
        if(v != p){
            dfs(v, i);
            dp[0][i] = (dp[0][i] * (dp[0][v] + dp[1][v]))%MOD;
        }
    }
    for(int v : adj[i]){
        if(v != p){
            dp[1][i] = (dp[1][i] * dp[0][v]) % MOD;
        }
    }
}
int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
    cin.tie(0);
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++){
        int u, v;
        cin >> u >> v;
        u--, v--;
        adj[u].push_back(v), adj[v].push_back(u);
    }
    dfs(0, -1);
    cout << (dp[0][0] + dp[1][0]) % MOD << '\n';
    return 0;
}
```
